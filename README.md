# Fluent-API
Fluent API is an API for Minecraft mod development. Fluent abstracts away interaction with Minecraft or any of it's independent mod API's (Fabric, Forge, MCP, etc). Fluent allows you to easily compile a mod that is compatible for any version of Minecraft and any modding API.

## Why?
Due to the split communities of Minecraft cheating, Fluent was invented by Rijndael to tackle the problem of creating a client for everyone. By using Fluent, Flow Client can be easily built for everyone, whether they prefer 1.8, 1.12.2, 1.20, Fabric, Forge, MCP, or anything else.
